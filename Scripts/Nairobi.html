  <h1> City Overview </h1>
  <p> Within a relatively short period of time, what was once swampland was reborn into the metropolis of Nairobi, the
    thriving capital city of Kenya. The transformation began when the railroad arrived in 1899, and a rudimentary camp
    and source depot was established at the location known to the Maasai as <em><span
        style="color: cornflowerblue">“Ewaso Naiberi,” or “abode of cool water.”</span></em>
    It was then nicknamed as “Mile 327”, quickly becoming a small village that continued to grow into a rustic town
    before becoming the capital of British East Africa in 1907, drawing in thousands of adventurers, hunters and
    travelers from around the world. Visiting the pioneer safari capital during your AfricanMecca dream vacation in
    Kenya takes you into one of the largest and most diverse cities on the continent, and gives you personal experience
    with what has become known as “Nairobi character”.</p>

  <p> This distinct African metropolitan offers many local attractions where you can learn about the history of the city
    and the cultures that make Kenya a unique destination for any type of traveler, as well as partake of international
    restaurants, shop, markets in a vibrant afro-urban scene.

    The promise of Nairobi is thriving, just as it has been for over 100 years, attracting visitors from diverse
    countries, who seek new wildlife viewing opportunities amidst the great Kenyan plains. The growth of the urbanness,
    though, has not created a staunch separation from the wilderness, as the African bush is present at the southern
    edge of the city in Nairobi National Park where prey animals, such as zebra, wildebeest, impala, giraffe buffalo and
    other herbivores graze with a watchful eye for stealthy predators, such as cheetah, lion, hyena, leopard and many
    more.

    You will simply be amazed at the proximity of the wilds of the plains, cliffs and forest that are 5 miles from the
    bustling activity of the city center. Trip out a little further to Thika, and you will find the gorgeous 88-foot
    waterfall known as “Fourteen Falls”.</p>
